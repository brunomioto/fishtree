#' fishtree: Interface to the Fish Tree of Life API
#'
#' fishtree makes it easy to access phylogenetic information about ray-finned
#' fishes with R. Download taxonomies, phylogenies, sequence matrices, and
#' diversification rate data with a simple set of functions.
#'
#' Implementation note: this package makes calls over the network and caches
#' its (sometimes large) results for faster loading. Because of this,
#' long-running R instances could use a lot of memory.
